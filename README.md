Google Home is a Wi-Fi speaker that can act as a personal assistant for the entire family. You can use it to playback entertainment throughout your home, effortlessly manage everyday tasks, and ask Google things you want to know. In this Project we are going to interact with Google home to search for properties which are available to buy and rent.  The Google home can trigger an email or a message to the respective agent dealing with the property and can act as a mediator for the transcations.

 The application uses Firebase, Google Dialg Flow and Nodejs
